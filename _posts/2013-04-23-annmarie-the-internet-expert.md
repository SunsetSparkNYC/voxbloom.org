** Hi, my name is Jaslin, and today we're going to interview Miss
AnnMarie. **

Hello!

** Hi. What's the name of your company? **

I work for a company called 11 Picas.  We do health blogs.
We help people be published online information, health kind of stuff.

** What's the most favorite thing you've done in your company? **

I like programming, so we write software...programs.  We write web
site programs.

** What your favorite program you've created? **

We created a dashboard for widgets where you can take these widgets
and put them on people's websites.

** We heard you used to work for the New York Times? **

I did.  I worked on the New York Times' website.

** What was your favorite articles? **

Well, I like their articles about movies.  I worked on a project where
we had to get all the movie reviews going back 75 years.  We would
find every movie review for every movie and then we would create a
web page about the movie and put the review on it.  It was fun reading
all of those articles where people were reviewing movies.

** What's your favorite movie? **

I like __The Wizard of Oz__.  It's probably one of my all time
favorites.

** What's your favorite part of __The Wizard of Oz__? **

I like when the monkeys come.  I think that's kind of funny.

** Oh, the winged monkeys? **

With the winged monkeys, yeah. Hah ha.

** And the hat. **

And the hat.

** What's your least favorite movie? **

I don't like movies with a lot of violence in them.  They have too
much violence, so any movies like that.  I don't like those.

** What was your favorite part of working for the New York Times? **

One of the things that was fun about it was that a lot of people look
at the site.  A lot of people know about.  If you write an application
or doing something, people would hear about it and know about it.  It
was fun working on something that had such a high profile.

** How did you get the job with the New York Times? **

At the time I was working for NYU on their website.  One of my
co-workers was recruited for a job at the New York Times.  After she
was there for a couple of weeks, they were looking to hire more
people.  She told me about that job.

** We heard that you wanted to become a math teacher. **

I did.  When I graduated from college I was an education major.  I
didn't going into education because I was also very interested in
this very new thing call the internet.  Somebody I knew had got me
a job at NYU where I was going to a chance to work on the internet.
In the early nineties the internet was very new.  I ended out doing
that instead of getting into teaching.

** What's your favorite thing about the internet? **

I like the instant communication of it -- that you can just contact
somebody almost immediately.  One of my other favorite things about
the internet is that you can stay in touch with a lot of people.
Before it was really hard to stay in touch with people that moved
away.  That's one of the good things about the internet.

** What do you think you could change about the internet? **

I would make people behave nicer, be friendlier with people.  People
can be a little mean because you can't seem them, so they write
what they want.  I would want people to be a lot nicer to each
other.

** How has the internet changed throughout the years? **

It's changed a lot over the years.  The first website I ever created
was all text, no pictures.  Once there were pictures, then videos.
How fast.  It used to take a really long time to download a small
file, and now you can do it in a couple seconds what used to take
an hour.  It's gotten a lot faster.

** How do you feel about the changes on the internet? **

I think it's great and exciting.  Everybody has these handhelds now.
There's a lot of different ways for people to use this technology.
They use it in ways that I never thought possible.  I like that you
can look up prices on things.  There's lots of different things I
like about it.

** How has the technology changed New York? **

I guess it's changed a lot of things.  There's technology now that
tells you whether the train is coming.  I'm sure they're going to do
that with the buses.  The technology has made maps a lot more
accurate.  I guess it's changed a lot how people get around and find
out about different events that are going on.

** What's your favorite website you've created? **

I think I talked about the movies section.  That was a good website.
I've helped some of my friends create websites for their art, which
is cool.  I have a friend who has a website about Transformers.  I
helped him do that website.

** I heard you also help out with robotics here at P.S. 24. **

I do help out on Saturday mornings at the robotics program here.  I
like it a lot.  It's a lot of fun.  We're creating animals this time.
We've created fast cars, things that pick up balls.  It's fun to
watch it go from nothing to build it up into something that's useful.

** What's your favorite robot or robots that have been created? **

We had one that would pick up these little capsule things that
Gaelen had.  I liked that one a lot.  We had a shot put one that
would throw a ball across the room to see how far it would go.  That
was a really good one too.  We've had some fun tug-of-war ones.

** What's your favorite thing about working on robotics? **

What I like a lot is when something comes together.  You have an
idea and then you're able to execute it well.

** Have you ever created a robot? **

I've created a couple different kinds, mostly with the Lego robots.
I've created other robots that sort of wind up and walk on smaller
kinds of things.

** What's your favorite robot that you've made?  **

Probably one of the tug-of-war robots I did with the school was one
of my favorites.

** How did the tug-of-war robots work? **

Somebody else had to make a tug-of-war robot too so that you'd have
two different people.  Then we would get a string and put the string
around the two robots.  They were set off in two different directions.

** Was it like a real game?  Did someone -- one of the robots --
really win? **

Yes, it was a competition.  Our robot won.  We had done a lot of
practice with it with books.  Ours was very strong.

** What's a robot you'd like to do in the future? **

In the future I would like to do a robot that walks.  I've done ones
that worked on wheels, but I haven't done anything that really walked.

** What's the most challenging robot you could make? **

Probably one that responds to you talking to it.  Like you saying
something and the robot talking back to you.  I imagine that would
be very hard to do.

** What do you think would make it really hard to do? **

I think it would be hard to do because you would have to anticipate
a lot.  You'd have to have the robot hear what you are saying or
pick up on certain words.  I imagine this is how it sort of works
now.  It would hear certain words and then respond to them.  That
would take a lot of programming.

** What's your favorite way of programming? **

One of my favorite programming languages is Python.  It's named
after a snake.  It's not a compiled programming language.  That's
one of the reasons I like it.

** How does it work? **

Well you type in some text into a program.  You create a file with
the text you want and give it different instructions.  You could
say "print the word hello" to give it an instruction to print a
line of the screen.  So you can have it ask a question and respond
to a question or an answer.  If it was a website you would put it in
a form and you would press the submit button.

** How has New York changed? **

Wow, New York has changed a lot!  I think it's more crowded than
when I was younger.  It seems like there are a lot more people around,
ha ha ha, then before.  It's a lot safer than when I was younger.  It
was a lot more dangerous when I was younger, so that's nice.  You can
walk around the streets a lot more.  One of the biggest changes is
along the waterfront here.  Mostly in Brooklyn, but a little bit in
Queens, they're building all those parks.  I think that's great.

** Do you what they're doing, that they're making parks on the
waterfront? **

I do.  I like that the people, that the public, can get access to the
waterfront.  Some of the parks they're making are... I like taking
the ferry on the east river.  That's a lots of fun.

** Have you ever walked on the Brooklyn Bridge? **

I have walked on the bridge.  Two years ago was the last time I had
done it.  I was on the Brooklyn side and I was with my 8-year-old
niece.  We looked across the way and there was a big blue smurf at
the South Street Seaport.  We decided to walk over the bridge and
check it out.  I think it was the weekend the Smurf movie opened. So
we kept walking across the bridge and looking at the smurf.

** What's your favorite part about the Brooklyn Bridge? **

I like all the big arches, all the brick, the pretty arches, that
the Brooklyn Bridge has.  I think it's really cool that you can walk
through the middle of it.  My understanding is that that's the only
bridge in the United States that you can walk through the middle.
Most bridges you can walk on either side, but not through the middle.
That's kind of cool.

** Did the Brooklyn Bridge exist when you were little? **

Yeah, the Brooklyn Bridge has been around for probably about 120
years.  It was definitely there when I was little.

** When you were little, could you walk on it? **

Yes, yes.

** When did they create the Manhattan Bridge? **

Well, the Brooklyn Bridge would be the first one.  The Manhattan
Bridge was probably the second one, not too long after that.  The
Williamsburg Bridge would have come later.  The Verrazano Bridge is
probably the newest.  Although, I think it's about as old as I am.  It
was built some time in the sixties.

** They were making the Verrazano Bridge when you were growing up? **

I think they just finished building it around the time I was born.

** What's your favorite of all those bridges? **

Probably the Brooklyn Bridge because it's the oldest and most well
known.  It's probably favorite.

** What's your favorite part about Manhattan? **

I just think Manhattan's very exciting.  There's always a lot of
things going on.  People are always moving fast.  Everyone always
seems dressed up.  I like the excitement of Manhattan.

** Have you ever been to Rockefeller Center on Christmas when they
do the Christmas tree?

I do, I have seen the tree.  I like to get to see the tree at least
once a year.  I did get to see it this year with all the lights. That
was nice.  I think it was Cartier, they had a light show on their
building.  That was kind of cool.

** Have you been ice skating in Manhattan? **

I've been ice skating at Wollman rink in Central Park.  I've been to
Chelsea Piers.  I've been to the one in Rockefeller Center twice. It's
kind of a long line for that one.  I don't think they let you skate
for that long.  Have you been the Rockefeller Center skating?

** Yeah. **

That's cool.

** What are your hopes for the future of New York City? **

I like to see that it continues to do well.  We're doing well now, I
would think.  I hope that it continues to stay good and nice.  I like
it the way it is, so I hope it stays the way it is.

** What are your hopes for the internet in the future? **

I guess I'd like to see it being used better in schools.  That it's
more available and easier to get internet in our homes.  I think
that still kind of a pain.  I hope it will be easier to get onto the
internet in the future.

** Do you want to change your job? **

I don't really, I like my job.  I'm working with a group of people
that I like working with and we're trying to get this company off the
ground.  We're doing blogs, websites, for people in the health care
industry.

** What sort of blogs? **

There's gonna be ones for doctors and different ones for nurses.
Maybe school nurses might have some blogs, information for school
nurses.  Different things like that.

** You're interested in health? **

I'm interested in health.  I'm hoping that we have this specific area
that maybe we could take our technology and use it in other areas too.
I think there's a lot of interest in health.

** What's your favorite part about health? **

I like health with the internet because it's a really good way to get
information out to people that people can use to make their lives
better.

** What do you think is going to happen with the internet in the
future? **

I think the internet is going to be connect to a lot more things.
They talk about our smart appliances.  I've read about the future
where the frigerator knows it doesn't have milk and will send you
a note to remind you to buy milk.  I wonder what other kind of
appliances -- maybe you couch will tell you you're sitting on it for
too long. Ha ha.  Something like that.

** Have you ever done an interview? **

I was interviewed once when I was still working for NYU.  I haven't
personally done any interviews of people before.  When we first
created the website down at NYU, I was interviewed about it.

** That you for letting us interview you. **

You're welcome.
