** Hi, my name is Jaslin.  Today we're going to interview Mr. Gaelen.
He is a computer programmer.  He teaches the robotics class and he is
the adult in the journalism class. **

Why thank you for welcoming me here, Jaslin.  You're going to
interview me?

** Yeah. **

Already, lets get to it.

** What's your favorite thing about computers? **

My favorite thing about computers?  I think I have two favorite things
about computers.  I like the technology -- that they are new and fancy
and you can take them apart and put them together -- but I also like
that you can make things with them.  You can look at stuff with them
and find out information.

** What sort of things do you make with computers? **

I make websites, but you can also make video games, or the news.  When
you write a paper, you write that on a computer.  You can make
pictures or movies.  You can make anything. Pretty much everything
today is made on computers, unless you're making pottery or something.

** How do you make websites? **

Depends how you want to make a website.  Do you want me to tell you
how you should make a website, or how I make a website?

** How you make a website. **

Ok, how I make a website. This is going to sound really boring.  I'll
try to make it exciting for you.  I have different programming
languages that I write in.  You speak Spanish and English.  If you
want to make a website you have to be able to write in one language
called HTML, another language called javascript, another language
called CSS, and another language that might be something called
Python. [The last language] could be anything. I write all these --
It's very boring, you write lines, you even look bored with me telling
you about this -- Basically it's a lot of writing things that look
like math kind of.

** Why do you need to know that many languages? **

Each language does something different.  One language just tells
computers how to talk to other computers or how to talk to a database.
A database is where you keep all your information.  There is another
language that shows you how the page should look.  Because the people
that made that language weren't very smart when they made it, there is
a whole other language just to make it look different colors. There's
all these different languages because people make things up as they go
along.  Maybe it would be good to do it all in one language, which you
can probably do, but -- yeah we do it all in different languages.

** Can you pick a language and just do it in that one language? **

It would be hard to do it with just that one language.  You usually
need at least HTML, but HTML is not that complicated.

** What's H-T-M-L? **

Do you know how when you go to a website, sometimes when you look at
the URL -- Do you know what a URL is?

** No. **

When you go to www.google.com, that's a URL.  A URL tells something
in English that then gets turned into a number.  Computers have
numbers.  Each computer has a number.  Computers only communicate
through numbers to each other.  Humans need -- they don't like numbers
-- words, like google, or facebook, or kids news, or whatever dot com.
That's the URL.

HTML -- I didn't even answer your question -- stands for Hyper Text
Markup Language.

** What's hyper text marks up language? **

Uh, It's HTML. Aren't you listening?

** I know it's HTML, but what does it mean! **

If you go home and go on your computer.  You have a Windows computer?

** Yeah **

You go to a webpage and you right click.  There's going to be
something that says "view source." Click view source. It's going to
show you the source of that [page]. That's the HTML.  It's just a
bunch of words, letters and characters that get turned into your
little pretty disney.com or whatever, but that all starts off as just
words.

** What do you do after you pick a language? **

Afer you pick a language, you've got to start writing the stuff you
want to make.  Maybe you're making something new.  If you're making
a game for a website, or -- what is a website you use?

** BrainPOP **

What does BrainPOP have?

** Games, videos. **

Lets say you pick a language and then you have to make stuff that
does what you want to do.  If you want to make videos, you have to use
that language to store the videos somewhere and to show it to people
on that webpage.  It's not all easy.  Videos -- in fact, before you
were born internet videos didn't even exist.  It didn't exist until
2003 probably, where people were really using it.

** I was born in 2003! **

Ok! So in 2003 people finally figured out and YouTube was inventeded [Note:
YouTube was actually invented in 2005], but before that it didn't
really work.  Anyway, your question was about what do you do after
you pick a language.  Well, you get to writing.  What do you do after
you start a science project and you pick your topic?  You gotta start
doing the science.

** Oh, okay.  And after you finish the writing, what do you do? **

Then you have to find a place to put it on the internet.  You have to
find a computer on the internet to put it on to show it to
everybody else.

** Like what?! **

If we got to Manhattan right now, there's building in Manhattan that
you can go into.  They're just filled with computers that don't
even look like computers.  They don't even have screens.

** What kind of computers are those? **

They're called servers because all they do is serve information to
people.  You don't go to them to look at games.  They don't talk to
humans, they only talk to other computers, so why would they need a
screen?  Computers don't look at screens; humans look at screens.
There are computers that are tall, maybe six or eight feet tall,
that's got 20 computers in it.  They look like books, really big
books. All they have are some blinking lights on them.  You need to
put your computer program on that.

** How are you going to put your computer program on that? **

The same way...over the internet.

** Since you're the adult in the journalism club, how did you actually
make the website? **

Make the website for our website?  I did it a really easy way.  I used
something called Jekyll, which is just designed to make really simple
websites.  I used that, then I used HTML.  We did CSS.

** What's CSS? **

CSS makes it look prettier.

** Oh, the color? **

It adds color to it.  Shows how things should be spaced out.  It
changes the font.  Remember when we changed out font?  That was with
CSS.

** What other computer programs have you made? **

When I was in college, I made really boring computer programs that
were no fun.

** Like what? **

like for homework assignments.  You know how sometimes you do
homework assignments and they tell you to write an essay.  But you
don't want to write that essay because it's boring.

** Yeah **

That's what computer projects are like sometimes in school.  They
tell you to do something and you're like, "that's really boring."  I
did a lot of boring ones.  When I got out of college, I worked for a
company that made video games, but for the government.  They were
video games we used to train soldiers for battles, for war.

** What sort of video games would train soliders, or how? **

It was just like video games you'd play on a Playstation 3.  We had
goggles that you would wear.  When you moved your head, it moved your
head in the game.  We had guns that had sensors in them, so that when
you moved the guns it also moved where you were at in the game.

** Oh, so it was like an action, where if you moved, the thing on the
screen moved? **

Yeah, yeah.

** So that was used to train soldiers? **

We also had ones for helicopter where it looked like a helicopter
cockpit.  That would hook up to the ones the soldiers were wearing.
We'd have one person who was pretending to fly a helicopter with a
video game on their screen.  Everything they did in the helicopter
would work in the game.

So that was pretty fun.  And then, when I moved [to New York City] I
started making stuff that did things for the news.

** Like what? **

We made computer programs that would read the news, then figure out
what the news was talking about.  If the news was talking about the
President, or maybe Christmas, or maybe schools, we would write
programs to figure that out.  [The programs] would tell other people
so that they could use the information.

** What was your favorite program that you created? **

My favorite program I've created -- I don't know if I have a favorite
computer program.  So many of my computer programs have just been for
work that I've never really had a chance -- I've worked ever since
I've left school and I've never really had time to just write the
programs that I want to write.  I've had a lot of fun making computer
programs with kids.  Last summer I did a computer program with a
kid at the library.  It was just a dumb video game, but it was really
fun making it.  I'd say that one.  Even if it was a really simple
computer program, it was a lot of fun making it because we did
everything fron scratch.  It was just a lot of fun.

** What are your hopes for computer programming in the future? **

My hopes for computer programming in the future are that more people
do it.  I was more kids to do it, more girls to do it.  Not a lot of
girls do computer programming.  Would you ever want to write a
computer program?

** I'll think about it. **

Ha, you'll think about it.  Alright, cool.  I hope people make more
fun things in the future.  I feel like a lot of computer programs are
just for money or to sell people stuff.  I hope in the future people
write more computer programs just for fun, just because they think
it's fun.

** So there you have it.  An interview with Mr. Gaelen, a computer
programist. **

A computer programist? That sounds so much better than computer
programmer, which was is people normally say.  Thank you, it was a
pleasure.
